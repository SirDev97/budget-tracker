# Budget-Tracker

Budget tracking app build with react and react bootstrap.

## Technologies:

1. React:

- Hooks, custom useLocalStorage hook for saving the budgets and expenses arrays in the users local storage.
- Context used to prop drilling.

2. Bootstrap

- Used react-bootstrap for the UI to get some practice with it.
- Design was not my main goal druing this project.
- The app is responsive tho.
